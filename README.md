# Frontend Mentor - Multi-step form solution

This is a solution to the [Multi-step form challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/multistep-form-YVAnSdqQBJ). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects. 

This frontend project is a responsive web application built using a mobile first workflow and various technologies including HTML, CSS, React, create-react-app, Redux Toolkit, and Tailwind CSS.

The primary objective of this project was to practice and improve my knowledge of Tailwind CSS and React, but it also provided an opportunity to learn and understand Redux Toolkit in greater depth.

The project was bootstrapped using create-react-app, which simplifies the setup process and manages dependencies for a React project. It uses Redux Toolkit for state management, and Tailwind CSS for styling.

Overall, this project was a valuable learning experience and allowed me to enhance my skills in these technologies. I hope it will be useful for others looking to learn more about them.
